One of the best parts of every weekend is turning on the tv and putting on a soccer game. There are tons of them, but we focus the most on games in the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), and the Bundesliga (Germany). These are three of the five biggest soccer leagues in Europe and attract lots of fans every weekend.

After years of looking at these games and seeing our favorite players, we began to wonder which nations make up these leagues. How many nations are represented in each league and which one is the most represented? Using a dataset from Kaggle, we decided to create interactive maps that show the makeup of each league during the 2021-22 regular season.

These questions then had us thinking about the interactions between clubs in each league. Do you ever look at the standings online and wish it gave you more information about the amount of goals each club has scored between each other? Well you are in luck because that is a frustration we had and decided to explore. First, we created a giant network connection for each league where each arrow represents the total number of goals one team scored on the other team in the regular 2021-22 season. However, these connections were extremely large and messy, so we decided to create another network connection for each team that ended in first at the end of the regular season (2021-22). We know that the team ended up in first because they had a great amount of wins, but by how much did they outscore their opponents? Which opponent did they have the hardest time scoring on? 



# Maps
##### On all three maps, you can hover over any area on the map, zoom in and out to better visualize the countries, and as you hover, you can see the number of players that come from each country.

### La Liga
```{r}
# import stuff for all maps (to be hidden)
soccer_data2 <- read.csv("wrangled_dataset.csv")

# some wrangling code bc won't just copy over >:

#Filter the leagues
Premier_League <- soccer_data2 |>
  filter(league == "Premier League")

La_liga <- soccer_data2 |>
  filter(league == "La Liga")

Bundesliga <- soccer_data2 |>
  filter(league == "Bundesliga")

#Number of players from each country for every league
 Num_players_PremierLeague <- Premier_League |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 
 Num_players_Laliga <- La_liga |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 
 Num_players_Bundesliga <- Bundesliga |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 

#Number of players from each country for every league
 Num_players_PremierLeague <- Premier_League |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 
 Num_players_Laliga <- La_liga |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 
 Num_players_Bundesliga <- Bundesliga |>
  group_by(full_country_name) |>
  summarise(num_players = n())
 
 

#LA LIGA

#Create map object
 world_map2 <-  maps::map("world", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE) |>
    st_as_sf()

# join the world map with the num_players
 La_liga_map <- Num_players_Laliga |>
   right_join(world_map2, by = c("full_country_name"="ID"))
 
#head(La_liga_map)

#Create a visualization

map_2 <- ggplot(La_liga_map, aes(geometry=geom, fill = num_players)) +
   geom_sf() +
   theme_void() +
   labs(fill = "Number of players"
       , title = "La Liga Map") +
   scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) +
    coord_sf(lims_method = "geometry_bbox", default_crs = NULL)
ggplotly(map_2)
```
##### From this map, we can observe that many players in this league originally come from Spain. This is because La Liga is a Spanish league.

### Premier League
```{r}
#PREMIER LEAGUE

#Create map object
 world_map1 <-  maps::map("world", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE) |>
    st_as_sf()

# join the world map with the num_players

 PremierLeague_map <- Num_players_PremierLeague |>
   right_join(world_map1, by = c("full_country_name"="ID"))
 
#head(PremierLeague_map)

#Create a visualization

map_1 <- ggplot(PremierLeague_map, aes(geometry=geom, fill = num_players)) +
   geom_sf() +
   theme_void() +
   labs(fill = "Number of players"
       , title = "Premier League Map") +
   scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) +
    coord_sf(lims_method = "geometry_bbox", default_crs = NULL)
ggplotly(map_1)

```
##### From this map, we can observe that many players in this league originally come from England. This can be explained by the fact that Premier league is an English league, so many players are English.

### Bundesliga
```{r}
#BUNDESLIGA

#Create map object
 world_map3 <-  maps::map("world", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE) |>
    st_as_sf()

# join the world map with the num_players
 Bundesliga_map <- Num_players_Bundesliga |>
   right_join(world_map3, by = c("full_country_name"="ID"))
 
#head(Bundesliga_map)

#Create a visualization

map_3 <- ggplot(Bundesliga_map, aes(geometry=geom, fill = num_players)) +
   geom_sf() +
   theme_void() +
   labs(fill = "Number of players"
       , title = "Bundesliga Map") +
   scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1) +
    coord_sf(lims_method = "geometry_bbox", default_crs = NULL)
ggplotly(map_3)
```
###### From this map, we can observe that many players in this league originally come from Germany. This is because Bundesliga league is a German league.

# Networks 
In the regular season, each team plays each other twice: once at home and once away. Therefore, we took the results of each game and summed up the results to see how many goals each club scored on each other in total. For example, when Arsenal played Chelsea at home, they lost 2-0. However, when Arsenal played Chelsea away, they won 4-2. Therefore, both teams scored 4 goals on each other during the 2021/22 regular season. In our network connections (both large and small), each arrow represents the amount of goals one team has scored on the other in the regular season.

Our large network connections show that there are connections between every team in each league. While it may be hard to interpret these connections, we can definitely still gather some results. For example, Everton, Norwich City, and Southampton in the Premier League all seem to have lots of goals scored on them. In fact, these teams were among the top teams in the Premier League with the highest number of goals against (goals scored on them). We can see similar results in the large network connections for La Liga and the Bundesliga. 

As for the smaller network connections, these explore the relationship between the team that ended in first place at the end of the regular season in 2021/22 and the rest of the other teams. While one or two teams may be questionable, it is evident that Manchester City outscored virtually all of their opponents in the Premier League. We see a similar trend with Real Madrid in La Liga and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Now, these are results we should expect, but it is interesting to see them laid out this way as opposed to in the typical standings chart.

The arrows from the other teams to Bayern Munich are the goals Bayern Munich conceded when playing away.


Hopefully this blog gave you some insight into the Premier League, La Liga, and the Bundesliga in ways that are not typically shown. It is easy to know where some of your favorite players in each league come from, but it is interesting to see the distribution of players around the world. It was not surprising that each league had the most players from the country in which the league is based, but perhaps you saw some countries represented that you did not expect to see. 

As for the network connections, they are a fun way to easily explore how teams scored against each other (overall). You may have easily known that Manchester City scored the most goals during the regular season, but the network connection for Manchester City lets you easily see how those goals break down between the clubs.
